/*
 * Main class
 *
 * This class should serve as the entry point for your program.
 *
 * Your main method should:
 *   - Create a database object to store all VideoObj instances.
 *   - Read in data from the ratings and basics .tsv files, and populate the database with VideoObj objects.
 *   - Call methods on the database to clean up, analyze, and print information about the videos (such as purging bad videos, printing statistics, etc.).
 *   - Print results to the console so you can see the output of your code.
 *
 * You may want to write helper methods for reading the .tsv files and for displaying results.
 *
 * This file is where you will put the code that "runs" your project and ties everything together.
